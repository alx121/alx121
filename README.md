ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alx121.

Really not much to see here; a Spanish student who has been learning Python 3 for a while now, (yes, I know some do not consider python a very fast or useful language if not for simple automation tasks, but I chose python as my first language because I wanted to get a general idea of how programing _felt_ like -to put it some way-, without getting my hands in anything too complicated).
Keep in mind though, that I'm very new to all of this; I mean, even just opening an IDE for the first time, (which wasn't too long ago, to be honest) overwhelmed me, (and I still am), so go figure ðŸ˜….

I made this account after github closed my OG one (@alxcg121) minutes after creating it Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

Although at the moment I do not plan to publish any of my personal projects and instead focus on learning, here's my contact info, (at the moment just my e-mail) just in case: alx.c.g@hotmail.com, (don't worry if the contact e-mail doesn't match my account's, this last one is just a forwarder).
